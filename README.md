An open source MATLAB toolbox for beamforming, processing, and visualization of ultrasonic signals. The USTB is developed as a joint effort of:
 
* [Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging of NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/isb), 
* [Department of Informatics of the University of Oslo](http://www.uio.no/), and
* [CREATIS Laboratory of the University of Lyon](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7/en).

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just clone the repository and add the folder (without subfolders) to MATLAB's path

### Citationware ###

The USTB is made possible through the contribution of several labs around the world. It contains pieces of intellectual property from many authors, and because of that different references must be cited depending on your use of USTB. There are three kinds of intellectual properties that must be acknowledged: datasets, processes, and the toolbox itself. Please se our website http://www.ustb.no/citation/ for details on how to properly refence the intellectual property. Be sure to reference our proceedings paper from IUS (IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium) 2017 whenever you are using the toolbox in research or other publications:

### Current version ###

This is the Julia implementation of the USTB. It is still being implemented, and will have some deviations from the USTB due to language differences. For the current release of the USTB for MATLAB, see:

*  https://bitbucket.org/ustb/ustb/src/master/

### Documentation ###
Documentation of the USTB is dependant on the source implementation. 
> Unfortunately, we have not had the time or resources to write a full documentation of the USTB. However, there are plenty of well documented examples that will help you to get started and hopefully understand the code. You find the examples under the /examples folder. 

### How to contribute? ###
If you want to contribute, please see the **How to contribute?** section of the source USTB implementation on Bitbucket [here](https://bitbucket.org/ustb/ustb/src/master/README.md).

### Did you find a bug or have suggestions? ###
